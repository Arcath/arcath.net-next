I've spent the last 10 years working as an IT Engineer in Schools. I've worked with all kinds of technologies, everything from Interactive Displays & Hall Audio systems through to USB Microscopes.

As an Engineer at Ed-IT Solutions, I've built Windows domains from scratch and designed school internet connections. I run a cluster of VPS Web servers and provide web hosting to schools.

I'm a component NodeJS and PHP developer that has worked on websites and web applications ranging from small shop Gatsby sites to school WordPress sites and data management apps.
