Fom state and events is something every one has a library for and I'm no exception.

`useForm` is a hook that handles the form state internally and returns an object for you to use in your component. The returned object is a collection of functions and variables that allow you to interact with the forms state.

You can find out more about `useForm` on its GitHub repository linked below.
