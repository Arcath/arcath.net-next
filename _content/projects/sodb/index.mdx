SODB is one of my oldest projects. I've used it on and off for since its creation with it making an appearnce in my [Screeps AI](/2017/06/screeps-part-12-start-again) for a while.

SODB create an ORM like interface around an array of objects. Leveraging the idea that an object looks a lot like a database record.

With Typescript you can _type_ the records making it even easier to use!
