One thing static site generators can lure us into is not caring about build
performance. If code works and the build passes quickly enough, it gets
overlooked.

I was building a new Code Component and, having to wait a minute for every
refresh was making the feedback loop extremely slow. Couple that with having to
restart the development server every few minutes and, it was unbearable.

## Read all the Files.

I started with the assumption that I was interacting with the disk too much.
This felt like the right place to start and, I knew one place that was an issue.

So the first problem area I want to look at is `getPostBySlug`.

```ts#5
export const getPostBySlug = async <K extends (keyof Post)[]>(
  slug: string[],
  fields: K
): Promise<Pick<Post, ArrayElement<K>>> => {
  const basePosts = await getPostFiles()

  const index = indexedBy('slugString', basePosts)

  const basePost = index[slug.join('-')]

  const post = await getPost(basePost)

  return pick(post, fields)
}
```

This function works and does get a post from its slug. However, it does it in
about the worse way it could.

`getPostFiles` uses `fs.readdir` to get a list of all the folders in the posts
directory. Which begs the question, why do I need to do it to get one post?

Once it has every post, it uses `indexedBy` from
[my utils library](https://utils.arcath.net/modules.html#indexedby) to create an
object of posts indexed by their slug.

That means two loops through every post on the site to get one post returned.

`getPost` then actually reads in the file's contents and returns the MDX and the
frontmatter.

To solve this, I need to ask the question, why are posts not directly
retrievable?

The answer is that in the folder names I put the _day_ of the post as well as
the year and month. The day is never used, and it would not be possible to use
it in slugs or anything like that without invalidating all my current
permalinks. So a quick rename of every folder to `year-month-slug` and
`getPostBySlug` now looks a lot better.

```ts#2-6
export const getPostFromSlug = (year: string, month: string, slug: string) => {
  const filePath = path.join(
    POSTS_DIRECTORY,
    [year, month, slug].join('-'),
    'index.mdx'
  )

  return getPost(filePath)
}
```

I can now _calculate_ the posts file path entirely from the data in the URL. No
more loops just a direct return of a file object.

## A File Proxy

Speaking of file objects. There is a lot of duplication between each _type_ of
content on this site. The main reason for this is to provide very acurate
typings. I decided that if I was going to try and improve file performance the
last thing I wanted to do was get it working for one content type and then have
to copy it to the others.

To that end I created a `File` object that handles all interaction with the
disk.

A `File` takes 2 type parameters. `Frontmatter` which is the data returned from
parsing the frontmatter and `Properties` which is the primitive data I can get
by parsing the file path.

As an example of `Properties` these are the properties of this post.

```js
{
  year: '2021',
  month: '06',
  slug: '2021-06-improving-nextjs-performance',
  href: '/2021/06/improving-nextjs-performance'
}
```

It doesn't really provide enough data to be useful to React but it is very
useful for a `File`'s internals.

A `File` has _getters_ for `content`, `data` and `bundle` which all return a
promise for a `string` or in the case of `data` an object of
`Frontmatter & Properties`.

This means that the `getStaticProps` for a post is now a very clean get the
post, bundle the post, return the post.

```ts
export const getStaticProps = async ({
  params
}: GetStaticPropsContext<{year: string; month: string; slug: string}>) => {
  if (params.year && params.month && params.slug) {
    const post = getPostFromSlug(params.year, params.month, params.slug)

    const source = await post.bundle

    return {
      props: {
        post: replaceProperty(
          pick(await post.data, [
            'slug',
            'title',
            'lead',
            'href',
            'tags',
            'year',
            'month',
            'date'
          ]),
          'date',
          date => date.toISOString()
        ),
        source
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Again `pick` and `replaceProperty` come from my utils library.

## Caching

I wanted to look at caching which given my data is already on disk meant working
with an memory cache.

When you do any research into Next.JS caching it is all geared towards keeping
your CMS data on disk to reduce the number of fetches. As I said my content is
already on the disk so that isn't a performance gain for me.

An in memory cache has 2 problems in Next.JS.

1. Next.JS runs its build in multiple global scopes so a simple cache wont
   persist between build runs.
1. The development server is a single process but the cache wont automatically
   be invalidated by file changes.

Ignoring both issues I created a simple global scope cache to hold file objects.

```ts
const fileCache: Record<string, File<any, any>> = {}

export const file = <Frontmatter extends {}, Properties extends {}>(
  filePath: string,
  properties: Properties
): File<Frontmatter, Properties> => {
  if (!fileCache[filePath]) {
    fileCache[filePath] = createFile(filePath, properties)
  }

  return fileCache[filePath] as File<Frontmatter, Properties>
}
```

With this builds are slightly more effecient, but its not really noticable.

Development is where this shines as being a single process this cache persists.
`File` objects cache the contents and bundle within themselves so once the
development site has read a file it doesn't have to again.

A quick `fs.watch` file watcher can then be used to clear the files internal
cache if the file on the disk changes.

## Any Better?

The build performance is about the same. Vercel did get the new site built
quicker but 1 result isn't enough to go on.

Development feels a lot better, pages compile faster and although the cache
isn't used every time, it is used enough to notice an improvement.
