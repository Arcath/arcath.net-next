[Jekyll-Atom](https://github.com/Arcath/Jekyll-Atom) is pretty slow at building sites.

There is a noticeable delay between hitting `ctrl-S` and the site being updated which really slows development.

The fatal flaw is the `jekyll build` is building the whole site every time which as your site grows results in longer and longer builds to the point that the preview server becomes pretty useless.

The latest [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version adds an experimental feature for doing incremental builds which is an extreme improvement. Usual disclaimer about experimental features not being 100% reliable which means although the speed is greatly increased there maybe some cases where you don’t get the results you are expecting.

I have enabled it on this blog by adding `incremental: true` to my `_config.yml` and only really found one issue with it. Adding a new post doesn’t cause `blog.html` to be updated so although the post exists and has been generated there is no link to it. This can be worked around by saving `blog.html` again.

I wont be making this a default option in Jekyll-Atom for now at least, if you want to use it just add to your `_config.yml`.
