I recently got into the [Atom](https://atom.io/) beta and have been using it for the past couple of weeks with no problems at all. One of the big features of [Atom](https://atom.io/) is that it is hackable to the point that it comes by default with a make new package command.

The only package I really use at the moment is [Zen](https://atom.io/packages/Zen) which is super simple, if you look at the source all it does it attach a couple of extra classes and supply a stylesheet.

Most of my work at the moment has been focused around [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) so it was as good a place as any to start thinking about a package. I quickly wrote [jekyll-new-post](https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-new-post) and threw it out into the wild but pretty much as soon as I fixed issue #1 I started thinking of other things I could get [Atom](http://atom.io/) to do for me and it quickly became apparent that jekyll-new-post was to focused a name.

## [Jekyll-Atom](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll)

Instead of creating hundreds of Jekyll themed packages I decided to bundle everything into one, this way if you are using Jekyll you just install this 1 package and get all the functionality instead of picking and choosing.

### What can it do?

First off it provides a bunch of snippets for HTML/GFM/MD e.g. `jv` expands to `{% raw %}{{ ... }}{% endraw %}`. A full list of the snippets appears in the settings when you install the package.

It then currently has 3 commands that can be triggered a multitude of ways. One to open the layout for the current document, so this post has `layout:post` in its front matter if I press `Cmd+Alt+L` Atom will open `_layouts/post.html` for me. Secondly it adds a command to the pallet to open `_config.yml` not the most ground breaking feature but its nice to have. Lastly it provides the same box as jekyll-new-post making that plugin redundant, anyone using it will need to disable it before using [Jekyll-Atom](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll).

Iâ€™m using this new plugin here with no issue but if you find one you can open an [issue on the github repo](https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-atom/issues) and I will look at it.

I have a couple of ideas for expanding it but I need to look more at how [Atom](http://atom.io/) works behind the scenes and whether I can link into things like autocomplete.
