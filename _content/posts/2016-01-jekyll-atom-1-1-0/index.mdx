[Jekyll-Atom](https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-atom) has just hit 1.1.0 and with this release comes some new features and adjustments to the current ones.

I outlined my ideas in the [state of the universe](/2016/01/state-of-the-universe) and I think I have met them all with this update.

## Configuration

In 1.1.0 the config is a lot leaner favouring settings from `_config.yml` instead of settings in your editor. This enables _settings per project_ which quite a few people had asked for.

`Layouts Dir` and `Layouts Type` are gone in favour of getting `layouts_dir` from `_config.yml` and guessing the type by finding a file with the name of your layout and opening it.

`Posts Dir`, `draftsDir` and `Posts Type` are gone as Jekyll doesn’t let you change them so they can be fixed in the code.

`Includes Dir` and `Data Dir` are gone in favour of getting `includes_dir` and `data_dir` respectively.

Build Command is now the _default_ build command and you can override it in your sites `_config.yml` like so:

```yaml
atom:
 buildCommand:
  - jekyll
  - build
  - --option
  - --this
```

`buildCommand` is the only option in the `atom` namespace so far but its open to change as time goes on.

## Under the hood

Big things have happened under the hood in this release. A massive re shuffle of the files and moving quite a few functions out into a `Utils` module.

All the commands are now in a wrapper that takes 3 options, the command to run, whether it needs to config loaded before it can run and whether it needs an active editor. This removes tonnes of duplication and makes everything a bit neater.

The draft commands now work reliably

## Build Speed

As I mentioned [in another post](/2016/01/improving-speed-in-jekyll-atom) this is more to do with Jekyll than Jekyll-Atom. To summarise you can greatly increase the build speed by adding `incremental: true` to your `_config.yml` which enables an experimental feature in Jekyll 3+ that only builds the pages that have been modified, it falls over with post lists on other pages etc… but for drafting purposes its pretty good.

## In Conclusion

1.1.0 is a big push forward that should make Jekyll-Atom a much more appealing package.

Any issues let me know in the github repository!
