I've seen some anti-Gatsby sentiment bubbling around recently. I normally ignore articles like this when they come along. It seems like every few weeks there is an article telling me I should abandon [React](https://reactjs.org/) for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), then that Vue is dead long live [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and a few weeks later another article saying React was fine. 

A lot of the things I was reading made a lot of sense, and I agreed with the points. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) had annoyed me with the way it splits your site in two with the GraphQL API in the middle. I like GraphQL, I've written two full-blown APIs using it, but I find Gatsby's GraphQL API hard to extend and can sometimes trap you into having to pull in lots of data for a simple query.

## Next.JS

So why Next.JS? [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) separates rendering and generation within the same files, unlike Gatsby where you have to write an isolated `gatsby-node.js` and use plugins to parse/fetch data and then output a page list.

I didn't start this rewrite expecting to go all the way to launch it. Whenever I want to try new technologies, I rebuild this site, it is relatively complex and has quite a few features which makes it a great _test case_. 

This rewrite has shown how much work had gone into the old Gatsby site and how powerful that platform was, Saying that, I do find that this Next.js site just makes more sense.

I went big into the Typescript in this site. One of my gripes with Gatsby, and GraphQL, in general, is that I have to manually type the result of queries which, of-course leads to bugs. 

So what have I done here?

Looking at posts, I have a `BasePost` interface that describes the basic data I have on the post before I parse it. `Post` extends `BasePost` with the data from the front matter and content of the post which requires actually reading the file. The functions that fetch the data then return this `Post` type. My data fetching functions take a `fields` argument so that I can limit the data being returned. Next.js creates a data file for each page, no need to have the whole page's content unless I need it. Fetching limited data then becomes as easy as calling one of the fetch functions.

```ts
// Home Page
const posts = await getPosts(['slug', 'title', 'href', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'lead'])

// Post page
const post = await getPostBySlug(
  [
    params.year as string,
    params.month as string,
    params.slug as string
  ], 
  ['slug', 'title', 'content', 'lead', 'href', 'tags', 'year', 'month', 'day']
)
```

Using `Pick<T>` allows me to make sure that the type exactly matches the data I am requesting. No more making sure I keep a query and type in sync.

Because these data fetching functions are just typescript I can use them outside Next.js as well, in my [social image generator](/2019/01/generated-social-images) for example. That post is outdated now and I may re-visit it as my new method is a lot cleaner.

## Tailwind

The other new resource I wanted to try out this time was [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I had used it on a React App within the company before and wanted to give it a go on something more creative.

I like Tailwind, I find it extremely powerful without getting in the way of what I want to do like other CSS frameworks. Tailwind requires you to know CSS, which I think is what I like about it. I found with Bootstrap and others that my own stylesheet was just me throwing `!important` at everything to make a buttons shadow slightly less obvious.

Tailwind is more than just a framework, the stylesheet in use on this site is _generated_ by Tailwind. My colours, sizes, and any other units I have named are merged into the stylesheet. For example I added a width of `dbl`, with a value of `200vw`, which can be used with any width class in Tailwind like `w-dbl`, `max-w-dbl` and many more.

I also use [purgecss](https://purgecss.com/) to remove all the unused classes and keep tailwind as light as possible for this site.

## Source

As with my Gatsby site I've made the [source code of this site available on GitHub](https://github.com/Arcath/arcath.net-next). You'll see my process of developing the site as I kept it private until launch.
