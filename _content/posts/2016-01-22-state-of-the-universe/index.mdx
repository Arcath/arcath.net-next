This site has just had a pretty major [re-design](https://github.com/Arcath/arcath.github.io/commit/de18e7adc43dce79ee6572fd23af624d95328ab1) which I am intending to be the start of me writing a lot more here.

## More writing

I do loads of cool things in my day job that deserve to be shared, if only to save some other poor soul the time of discovering the source of the fault.

I do have quite a few articles that never got published for one reason or another which needs to stop.

## Projects

I have a few projects that are actively used by the community which I have regrettably neglected over the past few months and that needs to change. I have a few ideas for improvements that also need to be brought into the world.

### ADAuth

[ADAuth](https://github.com/Arcath/adauth) I’m sorry to say is dead to me, along with the ruby language in general. I haven’t worked in ruby for over a year now (aside from the odd dips into `rails c`) and to work on ADAuth again would require a fair bit of re-learning which due to it being a security/authentication gem isn’t safe in my opinion.

We only use it in one Rails App now which is in the process of being re-written for Node.

I am happy to pass on any knowledge I can about how it works to anyone looking to replace it.

### Express-Permissions

I’m not sure about this project, I lost my need for it short term but I may pick it back up soon.

### Jekyll-Atom

[Jekyll-Atom](https://github.com/Arcath/jekyll-atom) is one of my more popular packages and it needs some love and attention.

In no particular order my ideas:

  - Remove Layouts/Posts/Includes/Data/Sites Dir options and get it from _config.yml instead.
  - Move Posts Type into _config.yml.
  - Remove Layouts Type and just open any file type.
  - Make Build Command the default build command and let users set the build command in _config.yml.
  - Allow users to set a default front matter in _config.yml that applies to new posts.
  - FINISH DRAFTS.
  - Try and improve the build speed.

### Motorway

Motorway is working well and is improving the way my projects _look_ and _feel_.

### sodb

I’m pretty happy with where [sodb](https://github.com/Arcath/sodb) is, it works really well and is pretty fast. Its development tends to be fueled by what I need it to do in other projects.

## Interesting things @ Work

I’m doing a lot at the moment with Windows 10 as I suspect most IT Engineers are which is shaping most of my work.

I have a long list of Domain Rebuilds to do at the moment which again is giving me plenty of time for experimentation so there should be some posts coming from that.
