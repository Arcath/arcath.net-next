Rhythm of War is the 4th novel in The Stormlight Archive, Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy saga.

As with all Brandon Sanderson books, I loved it. I had the same concern as Oathbringer that as a _middle_ book it was going to hold back and leave something for the finale but as before I was wrong. Rhythm Of War expands on so much of the underlying rules or Roshar. We see every side of the war and how it all interacts, the Rhythm of War.

I can't wait for the next book, and I'm very tempted to re-read the other books before the next one comes out. I found myself forgetting details from earlier books because of the years between reading.
