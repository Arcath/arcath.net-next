My Website built using Next.JS. This site has become a bit of an example of how
[mdx-bundler](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler) can be used with
Next.JS.

# Developing

Clone a copy of this repository to your computer and run `npm install` to get
all the dependencies.

# Making your own

If you would like to pull out my content and use the code for yourself you will
need to:

- Edit `_data/meta.json` to your details, taking care with the `productionUrl`
  as it is used in open graph images.
- Clear the content from each sub-folder of `_content`.
